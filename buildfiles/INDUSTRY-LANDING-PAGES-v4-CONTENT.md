## PAGE 1: FINANCIAL ADVISORY & WEALTH MANAGEMENT

### Hero Section
**Headline:** Strengthen Cybersecurity for Financial Advisory Firms

**Subheadline:** Implement security controls designed to address threats targeting financial services—while meeting ASIC cybersecurity expectations

**CTA:** Book Your Assessment

---

### The Threats Financial Advisory Firms Face

Financial advisory and wealth management firms hold high-value information that attackers specifically target:

**Business Email Compromise (BEC)**
According to ASD's latest threat report, BEC fraud is among the top 3 threats to Australian businesses. Financial advisors are prime targets—attackers impersonate advisors or clients to redirect funds or steal credentials.

**Client Data Theft**
High-net-worth client information, trading credentials, investment portfolios, and financial plans represent valuable targets for both cybercriminals and corporate espionage.

**Phishing Campaigns**
ASD reports phishing as the initial access method in 38% of security incidents. Financial services professionals receive sophisticated phishing attempts designed to steal credentials for trading platforms, CRM systems, and client portals.

**Credential Theft**
Attackers target advisor login credentials to access client accounts, execute unauthorized trades, or steal sensitive financial information.

**Ransomware**
Small financial advisory firms ($56,571 average loss for Australian SMBs per ASD) often lack the backup resilience larger institutions have—making them vulnerable to disruption and extortion.

---

### Common Security Gaps in Financial Advisory Firms

Based on security assessments across the Australian financial services sector, common vulnerabilities include:

**Insufficient Authentication Controls**
- Single-factor authentication on client-facing platforms
- Weak password practices across multiple systems
- No systematic credential management

**Inadequate Email Security**
- Missing email authentication (allowing domain impersonation)
- No advanced phishing protection
- Inconsistent staff awareness training

**Third-Party Platform Risk**
- Multiple platforms (portfolio management, CRM, custodians) with varying security
- Limited visibility into platform provider security
- Weak vendor assessment processes

**Backup Gaps**
- Untested backup procedures
- Backups accessible to ransomware
- No documented recovery processes

**Mobile Device Exposure**
- Advisors accessing client data from personal devices
- No mobile device management
- Unclear bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies

**Incident Response Deficiencies**
- No documented breach response procedures
- Unclear client notification protocols
- Limited incident detection capabilities

---

### ASIC Cybersecurity Expectations

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has increased focus on cybersecurity following major breaches affecting financial services:

**Regulatory Guidance (RG 256)**
ASIC expects financial services licensees to manage cyber resilience as part of operational risk management. This includes:
- Appropriate governance frameworks
- Risk assessment and management
- Security controls implementation
- Incident response capabilities
- Third-party risk management

**Enforcement Actions**
ASIC has taken action against financial services firms for inadequate cybersecurity practices. Demonstrating systematic security controls helps manage regulatory risk.

**Client Data Protection**
Financial advisors have obligations under privacy legislation and professional standards to protect client information. Security controls support these obligations.

### The Threats Accounting Firms Face

Accounting practices hold sensitive financial information making them attractive targets:

**Business Email Compromise**
Attackers impersonate accounting firms or clients to redirect tax refunds, GST payments, or other financial transactions. BEC is among the top threats to Australian businesses per ASD.

**Tax Fraud & Identity Theft**
Client tax file numbers, financial records, and personal information enable identity fraud. According to ASD, identity fraud is the most commonly reported cybercrime.

**Ransomware**
Practice management systems, client files, and tax return data are critical to operations. Ransomware attacks (11% of incidents per ASD) can shut down practices during busy season.

**Phishing Attacks**
Staff receive fraudulent emails appearing to come from ATO, clients, or software vendors. Phishing was the initial access method in 38% of incidents reported to ASD.

**Supply Chain Risks**
Accountants integrate with multiple platforms—practice management, tax software, MYOB, Xero, Class Super, BGL—each representing potential attack vectors.

---

**CTA:** Book Your Assessment

---

### The Threats Legal Practices Face

Legal practices face unique security challenges due to the nature of information they handle:

**Targeted Attacks on High-Value Cases**
Practices handling commercial litigation, intellectual property, or mergers & acquisitions face targeted attacks seeking confidential strategy, evidence, or client information.

**Business Email Compromise**
Attackers impersonate lawyers, clients, or opposing counsel to misdirect settlements, redirect trust payments, or steal confidential information. Among top threats per ASD.

**Privilege Breach**
Any security incident involving client communications potentially compromises legal privilege—affecting case outcomes and professional liability.

**Phishing & Social Engineering**
Sophisticated phishing attempts target lawyers with apparent court notices, opposing counsel communications, or urgent client requests. Phishing: 38% of initial access per ASD.

**Insider Threats**
Departing lawyers, support staff, or contractors with continued access to confidential client matters represent risk requiring systematic access management.

**Ransomware**
Legal practices can't afford operational disruption—court deadlines, settlement negotiations, and client obligations continue regardless of IT availability.
