## THREAT CONTEXT SECTION

### Headline
Australian SMBs Face Persistent Cyber Threats

### Body Copy
According to the Australian Signals Directorate's latest Annual Cyber Threat Report:

- **SMB owners experienced significantly higher rates of cybercrime** than other victim groups
- **Average self-reported financial loss for small businesses: $56,571**
- **Phishing was the initial access method in 38% of incidents** reported to ASD's ACSC
- **Top threats:** Email compromise, business email compromise fraud, identity fraud, and ransomware

**The pattern is clear:** Cybercriminals persistently target Australian SMBs because fundamental security gaps remain unaddressed.

**The good news?** The majority of these attacks succeed through common vulnerabilities—weak authentication, social engineering, inadequate backups, unpatched systems. Implementing foundational security controls significantly reduces your exposure to these threat patterns.

**That's what we do.** We help Australian professional services firms implement practical security frameworks designed to address the threats you actually face—then achieve certification to demonstrate your security program.
